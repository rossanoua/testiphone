Hi people!!!
I just trying to create SQL data base for my friend (iOS developer) for his iPhone app.
In the future i expect to working as frontend and/or backend developer. )))))
Sorry for my english and errors.
Thanks!

Oh, i'm fully forgot to tell you next thing:
I'm not a software engineer.
In past i'm a welder, more than 13 years of experience.

Life is full of surprises! :)
